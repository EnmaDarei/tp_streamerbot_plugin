# Enma's Streamer.bot plugin (Touch Portal)<br>
### [**[Download]**](https://github.com/EnmaDarei/tp_streamerbot_plugin/releases/latest)

I made this plugin because I was really annoyed by the fact that the other existing one doesn't show the action list in alphabetical order.<br>

## What does it do
- Run action from alphabetized list.
- Run action by entering its name.
- Run action by entering its ID.
- "Advanced" versions of actions let you send arguments with your action as well, you can use values/states for these arguments.
- Automatically update the action list whenever you make changes to it on streamer.bot.
- Automatically tries to reconnect to streamer.bot every 10 seconds whenever there's a connection error.
- Store information about recent events in states you can use for your buttons/events/actions.
