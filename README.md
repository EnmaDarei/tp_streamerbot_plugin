[[Download Latest Version]](https://archive.candyfloof.com/downloads/touchportal/streamerbot/latest)

## Features

### Action Flexibility

- **Run Actions Your Way**: Choose your actions from a list or directly type their names or IDs.
- **Custom Arguments**: Include any arbitrary arguments you want when you trigger actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Since this plugin allows you to pass whatever arguments you want, the limit is your imagination (or C# coding skills)!

- **Standalone executable**: No need to install Java or any extra software
- **Continuous Updates**: Built around real user feedbackâ€”because itâ€™s the tool I use for my own streams!
